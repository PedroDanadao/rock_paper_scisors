// print a welcome message to the player
// print how the player can choose each of the three options

// make a variable to record the points of the player, one for the points of the computer and 
// one for the draws

// make a function to get the computer choice based on a randomly generated number
    // generate a number between 0 and 2
    // if the number is 0 then return 'rock', if it is 1 'paper' and if it is 2 'scissors'(use a switch case)

// make a function to compare the player choice with the computer choice
    // get the strings of the player and the computer and attribute 'rock' to 2, 'paper' to 3 and 'scissors' to 5

    // check if both numbers are equal, if so then return a 'draw' value(0)

    // check if the double of the first number is less then the second number. If so then it is the case where the
    // user chose a rock and the computer chose scissors. In that case, return the win value(1)

    // check if the first number is more than the second number. If so then return a win value.
    // if not then return a loose value -1

// make a function to get a number related to a string('rock', 'paper', 'scissors')
    // use a switch case to get the number between 2, 3 and 5

// create a variable(i) to increment the number of matches between the user and the computer.
// It will be necessary to use it alongside a while loop to deal with possible misspells
// of the user. The variable will only increment when the user types a valid option

// make a loop to that will run five times, one for each try
    // get the player choice from the console and put it in a variable

    // check if the player choice is valid(rock, paper or scissor)
        // if the player choice is not valid, then warn the user about it and
        // redo the loop without incrementing the variable i

    // get the computer choice

    // print both choices in the console

    // compare the computer choice with the player choice

    // increment the player score, the computer score or the draw score based on the result of the compare function.
    // For this, use a few math expressions based on the result of both choices

    // print in the console the current score

    // print in the console that a new match will start

    // increment the variable i in one

// compare the results between the player and the computer and announce the winner(if the results are the same)
// then announce a draw
